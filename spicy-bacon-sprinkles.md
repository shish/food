Spicy Bacon Sprinkles
=====================

Context
-------
I wanted to make more things taste like bacon - I saw that some company had come up with
[Bacon Seasoning](https://www.deliciou.com/products/bacon-seasoning),
but I found that it tasted like "bacon-flavoured crisps" (ie, super-fake and chemical-y
and gave me a headache) rather than actually tasting like real bacon. After some trial and
error and mad-sciencing in the kitchen, I came up with something that isnt quite bacon
seasoning, but I use it that way (ie I sprinkle it on top of random other foods) and I
like it:

Supplies
--------

* 370ml Valentina Salsa Picante (I call this "hot sauce" but I don't know if that's correct)
* 750g Thick-cut bacon (I use a mixture of smoked and unsmoked because I don't know the difference, but thick-cut definitely works better than thin-cut)
* Mixing bowl
* Air fryer (I'm still not sure exactly what counts as an air fryer - I mean an oven tray with a mesh layer)
* Food processor (I keep calling this a blender but I think those are two different tools??)
* Oven paper

Process
-------
1. Bathe the bacon strips in hot sauce - I pour a little sauce into the mixing bowl, rub bacon into it, add a bit more sauce, add a bit more bacon, until ending up with a big pile

1. Leave it in the mixing bowl in the fridge for a while (I normally leave it overnight, I assume that this helps the hot sauce flavours to seep into the bacon, because if I skip this step then the hot sauce disappears completely in the next step and I just have plain bacon, which is also great, but you might as well skip the hot sauce completely if you don't have time for it to bond)

1. Put the strips onto an air fryer, trying to get as much surface area as possible exposed to the air

1. Put into the oven on a relatively low heat for a long time (100C for an hour? Need to confirm. I don't actually time it, I just keep checking until it looks right), the goal being to dry out the sauce while leaving some moisture in the meat
    * Often I end up taking it out of the oven and shuffling it about a bit, then putting it back in so that different parts are exposed and they dry evenly

    * There will be a layer of spicy fatty goo in the bottom of the tray, I'm sure there's a use for this but I haven't found one... (If you want your entire house to smell like spices and bacon, you could make a tallow candle?)
1. When the strips are dry to the touch, stick them into a food processor to break them into tiny pieces, which also reveals the moist bacon inside the dry spicy shell

1. Pour the tiny pieces onto some oven paper on a baking tray, put back into the oven to dry out; probably stirring it once or twice in the middle of cooking, so that you don't end up with the surface-sprinkles being burned and the underneath-sprinkles coalescing into a solid lump

1. When the little sprinkles are dry, they can be put into a tupperware and used whenever
